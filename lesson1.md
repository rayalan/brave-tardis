Lesson 1
========

All about commits. In this lesson, we are going to learn to:

- Configuring Git
- View commits
- View commit history
- Change the repository state to the a particular commit
- Adding files to the index
- Making commits from files added to the index

I highly recommend taking notes (perhaps in a text editor) although you can also scroll back in the terminal to see older content.

Exercise 1: Configuring Git
---------------------------

Let's configure this Git repository. These settings will not affect any other repository.

1. Run `git config user.name "{your first name} {your favorite animal"` For example, `git config user.name "Alan Wolf"` (Note that the double quotes do matter since there is a space in the line.)
2. Run `git config user.email {your first name}.{your favorite animal}@{place your animal lives}.com` For example, `git configure user.email alan.wolf@den.com`
